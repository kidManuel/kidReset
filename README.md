#### A 2020 solution to a 1995 problem

We all can thank Eric Mayer for his seminal 2007 piece 'reset.css', but 13 years later, the hardcore underground css scene needs a shakeup. 
Enter kidReset, a **heavily** opinionated remix of the original piece.

##### Improvements:
- We don't target obsolete tags (you shouldn't be using them in the first place).
- We don't try to fix IE7 weirdness. If your users are using archaic browsers, they can handle minor stylistic differences.
- Border-box as default
- God bless vw/vh
- We aim for minimalism. Nobody *really* uses <blockquote>
